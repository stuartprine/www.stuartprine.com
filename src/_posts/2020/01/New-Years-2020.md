This is the year I stop hesitating.  I jump into whatever it is I want to go after.  I stop giving time to things that don't matter and I commit to those that do.  This is the year I actively work on my issues instead of talking about them like they're an inextricable part of me.  That means asking for help if I need to, therapy maybe.  This is the year that I remember how fragile life is.  I work hard for a life of growth with the people I love, and I enjoy the moment as much as possible.  This is the New Year. Bring it.
